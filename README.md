# Discord Market
- Discord Market is a plugin very similar to common AH plugins found on many servers
- The difference is, it doesnt let you sell the Item, it creates a listing on discord
  - This Promotes Player contact since you have to actually meet up ingame to buy it
- It is just a fancy way to advertise items ingame using discord

-# Thanks to @checkpoint486 on discord for the idea (AnimeSMP) 

# How does it work?
- It uses the Java Discord API (net.dv8tion.JDA)

# How to use it?
- Install the plugin
- Start the server with the plugin installed
- Stop the server
- Locate config.yml in the plugin's data folder
- Put your discord token and the id of the channel you want it to send messages into

- Watch this tutorial ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgSRXd95Nt0") to learn how to make your own bot (Its a tutorial for a similar plugin)
